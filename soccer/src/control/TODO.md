##Optimization/Learning
1. Write program to run agent with programmatically generated parameter values

2. Write program to run agent and get fitness values back

3. Write program to run agent many times, getting fitness

4. Updating parameter values each iteration with reinforcement learning

##Physics
1. Implement waving an arm as a .skl, with a parameter (to use to test optimization)

2. Implement getting up as a .skl

3. Define macros to extend the .skl language beyond just SetTar - e.g. Stabilize, MoveWhileStabilized (if we get pushed while executing a skill)

4. Implement kicking the ball as a .skl

5. Implement taking a step as a .skl

6. Implement walking as a .skl

7. Implement running as a .skl



Eventually: Tune PID controllers to not use the same value for every single joint, fix integral windup (if it occurs)
